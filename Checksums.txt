Errors can occur during the download of CentOS ISOs, even if your download manager reports none. 
Therefore it is very important to check that the files have not been corrupted in any way. 
This is the purpose of the CHECKSUM files (md5sum.txt.asc, sha1sum.txt.asc, sha256sum.txt.asc) we include in the iso directory

    .asc(Action Script Communication)

sha256sum <name>.iso

touch test.txt

md5 test.txt

    MD5 (test.txt) = d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e
