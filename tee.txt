tee is a command in command-line interpreters (shells) using standard streams 
which reads standard input and writes it to both standard output and one or more files, effectively duplicating its input

echo "hello world" | tee OUTPUT

    hello world

ls  // OUTPUT

echo "hello world" | tee -a OUTPUT > /dev/null

    // ""

ls // OUTPUT
