lsblk  // NAME MAJ:MIN RM RO SIZE TYPE MOUNTPOINT
          NAME: This is the device name
          MAJ:MIN: This column shows the major and minor device number.
          RM: This column shows whether the device is removable or not. Note in this example the device sdb and sr0 have their RM values equals to 1 indicating they are removable
          RO: This indicates whether a device is read-only. In this case all devices have a RO=0, indicating they are not read only
          SIZE: This is column give information on the size of the device
          TYPE: This column shows information whether the block device is a disk or a partition(part) within a disk. disks, read-only memory(rom)
          MOUNTPOINT: This column indicates mount point on which the device is mounted

sudo file -s /dev/xvdb   // check file system TYPE

sudo mkfs -t ext /dev/xvdb   // format the volume

sudo mkdir /mount_point   // create a mount point directory for the volume. mount point is where the volume is located in the file system tree and where you read and write files to after you mount the volume

sudo mount /dev/xvdb /mount_point   // mount the volume at the location you just created

lsblk  // xvdb disk /mount_point

* fstab - static information about the filesystems

The first field (fs_spec).
              This field describes the block special device, remote
              filesystem or filesystem image for loop device to be
              mounted or swap file or swap partition to be enabled

The second field (fs_file).
              This field describes the mount point (target) for the
              filesystem

The third field (fs_vfstype).
              This field describes the type of the filesystem.  Linux
              supports many filesystem types: ext4, xfs, btrfs, f2fs,
              vfat, ntfs, hfsplus, tmpfs, sysfs, proc, iso9660, udf,
              squashfs, nfs, cifs, and many more

The fourth field (fs_mntops).
              This field describes the mount options associated with the
              filesystem.
              It is formatted as a comma-separated list of options - defaults, noauto, user, owner, comment, nofail

The fifth field (fs_freq).
              This field is used by dump(8) to determine which
              filesystems need to be dumped.  Defaults to zero (don't
              dump) if not present

The sixth field (fs_passno).
              This field is used by fsck(8) to determine the order in
              which filesystem checks are done at boot time.  The root
              filesystem should be specified with a fs_passno of 1.
              Other filesystems should have a fs_passno of 2.
              Defaults to zero (don't fsck) if not present
