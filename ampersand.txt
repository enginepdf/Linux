File descriptor

    In Unix and Unix-like computer operating systems, a file descriptor (FD, less frequently fildes) 
    is a unique identifier (handle) for a file or other input/output resource, such as a pipe or network socket.

    File descriptors typically have non-negative integer values, with negative values being reserved to indicate "no value" or error conditions.

        0 : Standard input
        1 : Standard output
        2 : Standard error


&& (AND)

    command1; command2   # even if command1 fails, command2 to be executed

    command1 && command2  # only if command1 succeeded, command2 would be executed


.. & (at the end of a command)

    If a command is terminated by the control operator &, the shell executes the command 
    in the background in a subshell. The shell does not wait for the command to finish, and the return status is 0.


|&

    If ‘|&’ is used, command1’s standard error, in addition to its standard output, 
    is connected to command2’s standard input through the pipe; it is shorthand for 2>&1 |.

        '|&' is the same as '2>&1'


* There  are  two  formats  for  redirecting standard output and standard error:

    '&>word'    '>&word'

      Of the two forms, the first is preferred.  
      This is semantically equivalent to '>word 2>&1'


&>

    &>name is the same as >name 2>&1


>&

    2>&1 redirects the standard error to the standard output so they appear together 
    and can be jointly redirected to a file


\&

    escape '&'
    echo a \& b  # a & b


command1 & command2 & command3

    three commands run at the same time, in separate sub-shells. 
    Their stdout will still be attached to the parent shell, so if running this from a Linux terminal, 
    you will still see the outputs


``` ampersand.sh

{ echo stdout; echo stderr >&2; }

    # stdout
    # stderr

{ echo stdout; echo stderr >&2; } >/dev/null 

    # stderr

{ echo stdout; echo stderr >&2; } >/dev/null 2>&1  

    #

{ echo stdout; echo stderr >&2; } 2>&1 >/dev/null  

    # stderr

```
